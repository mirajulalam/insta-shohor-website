        <h1 class="section-title">Javascript Question</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Question No1 : How does javascript work?</h2>
            <p>Javascript is an dynamic programming interpreted language, not a compiled language.And single-threaded
                programming
                language.Javascript V8 justin time compilar code excute run.JavaScript it's important to know how it
                works under the hood. There are two important pieces to learn about: How the web browser works, and the
                Document Object Model (DOM).The source code is passed through a program
                called a compiler, which translates it into
                bytecode that the machine understands and can execute.It totally depends on the web-developers how they
                use JavaScript and for what, because it can be used for several things in web development. One of the
                most common uses of JavaScript is to validate data given by the user in the form fields.The
                Call Stack is a data structure which records basically where in the program we are. If we step into a
                function, we put it on the top of the stack.JavaScript is what is called a Client-side Scripting
                Language. Inside a normal Web page you
                place some JavaScript code See How Web Pages Work for details on Web pages. When the browser loads the
                page, the browser has a built-in interpreter that reads the JavaScript code it finds in the page and
                runs it. </p>
            <h2>Question No2 :What does javascript even loop do?</h2>
            <p>A single-treaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language.I have a call stack,an event loop,a
                callback queue some other apis and stuff Hey v8.In computer science, the event loop is a programming
                construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.Since V8 has
                just one call stack, how then does JavaScript run concurrently and asynchronously without blocking the
                main execution thread.JavaScript runs each code line by line, one after each other(single-threaded). As
                expected, the first line gets printed in the console here, but why is the last line printed before the
                timeout code? Why doesn't the execution process wait for the timeout code(blocking) before going ahead
                to run the last line.Some other thread seems to have helped us execute that timeout since we are pretty
                sure a thread can only execute one single task at any point in time.The event loop is a process that
                waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack.
                Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If
                there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats
                the same process.The above diagram demonstrates the basic workflow between the Event Loop and the Task
                Queue.</p>
            <h2>Question No3 : Local storage and Session storage Difference?</h2>
            <h5>LocalStorage :</h5>
            <p>Local storage stores data with no expiration date. localStorage remain till the browser cache is
                cleared.Shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.The data does not expire. It remains
                after the browser restart and even OS reboot. The
                localStorage is shared between all windows with the same origin, so if we set the data in one window,
                the change becomes visible in another one.</p>
            <h5>sessionStorage :</h5>
            <p>Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser whereas.sessionStorage is lost the moment
                the browser is closed.The sessionStorage object is used
                much less often than localStorage.The sessionStorage exists only within the current browser tab.Another
                tab with the same page will have a different storage.But it is shared between iframes in the same tab
                (assuming they come from the same origin).The data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening the
                tab. Thatâ€™s exactly because sessionStorage is bound not only to the origin, but also to the browser tab.
                For that reason, sessionStorage is used sparingly.</p>
